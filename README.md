This Streamlit application allows users to upload a CSV file, perform data preprocessing, visualize data distributions, and conduct clustering analysis using K-Means and DBSCAN. The application also includes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction and better visualization of clusters.

Features
File Upload: Upload CSV files with configurable options for header row, separator, and encoding.
Data Preview: View the first and last few rows of the dataset.
Statistical Summary: Get a statistical summary of the dataset, including the number of rows and columns, column names, and missing values.
Data Preprocessing: Clean data by removing duplicates, empty rows/columns, and handling missing values. Normalize data using Min-Max scaling or Z-Score normalization.
Data Visualization: Visualize data distributions using histograms and box plots, and compute correlation matrices.
PCA and LDA: Perform PCA and LDA for dimensionality reduction and visualize the results.
Clustering: Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method and perform clustering using K-Means or DBSCAN. Visualize the resulting clusters.
